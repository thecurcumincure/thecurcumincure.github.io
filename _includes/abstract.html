      RESEARCH ABSTRACT
      Circadian disruption is a potent driver of neuroinflammatory signaling and has been implicated in a range of neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative conditions. However, therapeutic strategies that safely mitigate inflammation induced by circadian rhythm disturbance remain limited. In this study, we investigated the anti-inflammatory potential of curcumin, a plant-derived polyphenol with known neuroprotective properties, in a rat model of systemic circadian misalignment. Rats were subjected to a chronic 12-hour light/dark phase reversal (12L:12D photoperiod shift) to induce circadian desynchrony and were treated daily with either oral curcumin (40 mg/kg in almond butter vehicle) or vehicle alone. Inflammatory responses were quantified by plasma pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-a, IL-6, CXCL1; ELISA), gut-associated lymphoid tissue size, and gut microbial composition via metagenomic sequencing.Curcumin treatment significantly reduced systemic markers of inflammation: plasma cytokines were reduced by ~70%, Peyer's patch size by ~50%, and significant reduction in the relative abundance of pro-inflammatory microbiota compared to vehicle controls. These findings suggest that curcumin modulates neuroimmune signaling through peripheral cytokine suppression and restoration of gut microbial homeostasis-key components of the gut-brain axis. This work supports curcumin's potential as a non-pharmacologic strategy to ameliorate neuroinflammation triggered by circadian rhythm disruption, with implications for shift work-associated disorders, mood dysregulation, and neurodegenerative disease risk.
