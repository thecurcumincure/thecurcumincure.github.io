    <h1>Neurological Benefits of Curcumin</h1>
    <p>
      In addition to fighting inflammation, curcumin has several other benefits including neurological ones. Curcumin is non-toxic and therefore passes through the blood-brain barrier, meaning it can have positive effects in the brain as well as the body.

      <h2>Curcumin</h2>
      <p><strong>chemical formula:</strong> C₂₁H₂₀O₆</p>
      <p>
        Curcumin is an organic compound made up of only carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. It's a pure substance, so when it’s broken down it becomes dihydrocurcumin, tetrahydrocurcumin, etc.

      <h2>Genetic Regulation</h2>
      <p>
        Curcumin has been shown to increase docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in the brain (See: Salem N Jr, Litman B, Kim HY, Gawrisch K. *Mechanisms of action of docosahexaenoic acid in the nervous system*. Lipids. 2001 Sep;36(9):945–59. doi: 10.1007/s11745-001-0805-6. PMID: 11724467).
        DHA increases cellular phosphatidylserine, which strengthens the cell membrane and helps with cell signaling. Thus, curcumin can aid with brain function.

      <h2>Bacterial Regulation</h2>
      <p>
        By increasing gut eubiotic bacteria such as firmicutes, curcumin has many downstream effects. Firmicutes are associated with short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which help reduce stress and anxiety (see: van de Wouw M, Boehme M, Lyte JM, et al. *Short-chain fatty acids: microbial metabolites that alleviate stress-induced brain-gut axis alterations*. J Physiol. 2018 Oct;596(20):4923–4944. doi: 10.1113/JP276431. Epub 2018 Aug 28. PMID: 30066338; PMCID: PMC6187046).

      <h2>Circadian Rhythm Regulation</h2>
      <p>
        Curcumin has trace amounts of melatonin. It also helped the mice used in my study adjust faster to their new time zone when severe circadian rhythm disturbance was induced.
